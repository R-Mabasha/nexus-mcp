# Plan
## Introduction
This plan outlines the approach to analyzing the codebase components inside `src/core` and `src/swarm`, with a focus on the LLM connection to Groq using litellm.

## Metrics
The following metrics will be tracked:
* Code complexity and modularity
* LLM performance and accuracy
* Groq integration and litellm usage

## Improvement Opportunities
The following areas have been identified for improvement:
* Modularize the codebase
* Improve documentation
* Integrate testing frameworks
* Explore additional AI/ML integrations

## Potential Features
The following features have been identified for potential integration:
* NLP tools
* Data visualization tools
* Cloud or distributed computing integration
